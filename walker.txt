Name: 		PMWALKER2
Descripcion: 	One way to get an animated icon
Date: 		2022-04-10
Version:	4.1
----------------------------   

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This is a PM sample application that will run a little animation on the top-left icon of the PM window. 


REQUIREMENTS
------------
- yum install gcc libc-devel binutils kbuild-make

COMPILE INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------
This version of this sample was modified to compile on ArcaOS with GCC 9 compiler. 
1) Remember to have correct OS/2 toolkit header files your path. For GCC the correct ones are the included on the "libc-devel", not the ones from the OS/2 Toolkit.
2) Run "nmake" or "nmake 2>&1 |tee make.out" to get the log file.


TOOLS USED
----------
- ArcaOS	- Verion 5.0.6
- RC 		- Version 4.00.011 Oct 10 2000
- gcc		- gcc (GCC) 9.2.0 20190812 (OS/2 RPM build 9.2.0-5.oc00)

- nmake		- Version 4.00.001 Oct  4 2001
or
- make 		- Version 3.81 k2 (2017-11-10)

TROUBLESHOOT
------------
The compile produce will run by just executing "nmake" (or "make") on the directory. If you want to save the log file you can run it as "nmake 2>&1 |tee make.out". The log will be saved into the "make.out" file.

HISTORY
---------- 
- r4.1 - 2022-04-10
Removed C code warning that was showing with gcc -Wall parameter. 

- r4 - 2022-04-01
Reduced DEF file and added release version for bldlevel.
Improved makefile to support nmake and GNU make.
   
- r3 - 2022-03-30
Modified version for GCC 9, ArcaOS 5.0.6 by Dave Yeo.
Updated to compile with newer GCC's like installed with RPM and using kLIBC or libcn.
Added clean target, nmake clean

- r2
Modified version for OS/2 2.0 and gcc by David Charlap.

changes were made from the original sources (Lee S. Fields, 1989) in November, 1992 to get walker to run under OS/2 2.0 and compile with GCC/2:

The Msg parameter of ClientWndProc changed from USHORT to ULONG Prototype for ClientWndProc moved to walker.h, where it belongs.
Instances of NULL changed to NULLHANDLE where necessary.  This should have been done under OS/2 1.3, since NULL is a pointer and NULLHANDLE is an integer.

More frame creation flags added to get the window to appear.
WinSetWindowPosition() call added to make window visible and active
WM_PAINT handler added so the window fills in white instead of being
    left not drawn
walker.def modified - export changed to _ClientWndProc, since GCC/2
    prepends an underscore to EXPENTRY code, contrary to IBM convention.
Icons updated to OS/2 2.0 format, 16x16 icons added so the walking man in
    the system menu box looks OK.
A make file was written.

Changed to a 32-bit app which will only run under OS/2 2.0.
Compiled with GCC/2, but it should easilly compile with C Set/2 or EMX/GCC with a minor change to the .DEF file.

With minor changes, it should compile fine under OS/2 1.x as well.
These changes include converting the icons (*.ICO) from 2.0 format to
1.2 format, and changing the Msg parameter to ClientWndProc from a
ULONG to a USHORT.
